This code is a WIP

In general, user_interface_draft3.py is intended to replicate the user interface and menus. It is an example of what this could look like. 

The back end is handeled by model_draft3.py. It is dependent on MoorPy and the MoorPy library. It requires NREL/MoorPy#37 to be merged before it is functional.

The PPT lays out what this would look like in SAM, and what assumptions are made in model_draft3.py, and instructions for the use of user_interface_draft3.py
