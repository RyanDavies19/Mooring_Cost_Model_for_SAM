This code is a WIP

In general, user_interface_draft2.py is intended to replicate the user interface and menus. It is an example of what this could look like. 

The back end is handeled by model_draft2.py. While it is functioning, this is not a finished code. 
It does not have a full set of coefficients and some of the estimates are placeholders. We likely will want to 
increase the MoorPy dependency given that SAM has a python interpretor. 

The PPT lays out what this would look like in SAM, and what assumptions are made in model_draft2.py, and instructions for the use of user_interface_draft2.py
